Am I the only one to think that [this](https://live.leapmotion.com/index.html "Leap") is not the future of interfaces ?  
I won't talk of it as a gimmicky innovation because this seems to be **an heavy technical improvement.** And it is important to innovate, even with solutions that are not totally usable today (because they can lead to useful and usable improvements for tomorrow).
However, as Bret Victor wrote in his [excellent article](http://worrydream.com/ABriefRantOnTheFutureOfInteractionDesign/ "A brief rant on the future of interaction design") (he is talking about touch interfaces) :  
>"To me, claiming that Pictures Under Glass is the future of interaction is like claiming that black-and-white is the future of photography. It's obviously a transitional technology. And the sooner we transition, the better."  

And leap motion is obviously still in the tactile transitional step. Let me quote Bret Victor again :  
>"The most important thing to realize about the future is that it's a choice. People choose which visions to pursue, people choose which research gets funded, people choose how they will spend their careers."  

From that point, my question is : Is Leap Motion following the good path of innovation ? Or less pretentiously : Do I believe in this path ? And my answer is clearly "no".  

Firstly, Leap Motion seems really unusable. It belongs to the same family as other tactile interfaces, that are already not really usable. In my opinion, this is even worst here : you do not touch anything, you do not have a "glass" to push on and to slow down your moves. You have to retain your moves, to control them more precisely than with classical touch devices. I am not an expert in human motions, but I really think that this is more painful and difficult to handle in a daily real life use.  

Secondly, and this is also true for every touch device, I clearly think that this kind of interaction is really poor in term of user value. Again, I can only advice to read the Bret Victor's article : We miss a lot of things with this kind of touch interfaces, and **we could probably do better and focus innovation on it.**  

These are the reasons why I think that this is not the future of interfaces. I praise the achievement and I am sure that it will lead to a lot of great things, but I really think that this solution belongs to the past.
